# Apple Watch & WatchKit

On April 2, 2015, I gave a talk to [CocoaHeads DC](http://www.cocoaheadsdc.org/) about the [Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/watch/) and [WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/). This repo contains the talk (Keynote, PDF) and a sample demo Swift project I built live, during the talk, to delineate the basics of building a WatchKit App.

If there are any questions, please feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ArtSabintsev) or via email on [my website](http://www.sabintsev.com).

Best,
